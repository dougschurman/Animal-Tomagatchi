Algorithm for Perfect Pet
Goal: Make a program using abstract objects to hold pets a user can interact with
Input: Only input from the user is the options to interact with the pets
Output: A saved file of all the user's pets to load data from

First steps were to make the abstract attribute object and the 3 corresponding attributes. This was then aggregated into an abstract pets object which had 3 extensions of animals.

These animals were able to be created in a text based menu system and then saved and loaded with serialization.
